# AI_Project

Summary
===============
Our project is to give the users recommendations based on the similar users. We used collaborative filtering, Matrix Factorization technique to achieve this.

Dataset
============
We used dataset of movie ratings provided by movielens, which contains movie id, user id, ratings and timestamp.

**Name** : ml-latest-small, ml-100k

- SVD
- Weighted matrix factorization

Observations
==================
- We achieved root mean square error of 1.0018 when we take latent features(k) as 5 for svd.
